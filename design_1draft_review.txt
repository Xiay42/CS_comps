Done with Michael, aka mr. nebuchadnezzar
Design by Team kyri; draft1/design.txt in kyra’s repo

Things I like:
Practical vulnerability list, we’ve talked about most of the stuff in class
Vulnerabilities have concerns and examples attacks related to imaginary scenario

Concerns and/or suggestions:
It’s unclear how to implement a cookie attack (what kind of attack that gets you admin perms?)
The 3rd attack is confusing, why do we want to only upload bad files if we are not admin
Lacks clear instruction on how to chain the cookies, sql injection attacks together
The imaginary scenario is a bit unclear (what are the databases stored in the bakery server, who has what access permissions?)

Design by Team Manic Meese: draft1/design.md in Cole’s repo

Things I like:
Comprehensive list of vulnerabilities
The top ten list linked looks like a great resource
Use of DDOS for a course-relevant purpose
“As a user you are fine with this because you know Gaggle is a good hearted company and would never sell your data” has me DYING

Concerns and/or suggestions:
How would one share images with friends if they were only accessible by admin?
Gaggle would be immediately beset by internet pranksters labeling photos of ducks as pianos :)
Unclear why specifically the servers are vulnerable to ARP spoofing/what the conditions are such that makes them vulnerable?
Might have trouble making sure the DDOS crashes the server and then automatically reboots rather than just overwhelming it?
